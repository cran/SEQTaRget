Description: Implementation of sequential trial emulation for the analysis of observational databases.
    The 'SEQTaRget' software accommodates time-varying treatments and confounders, as well as binary
    and failure time outcomes. 'SEQTaRget' allows to compare both static and dynamic strategies,
    can be used to estimate observational analogs of intention-to-treat
    and per-protocol effects, and can adjust for potential selection bias
    induced by losses-to-follow-up. (Paper to come).
