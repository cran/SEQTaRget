\format{
A dataframe with 5,976 rows and 11 columns:
\describe{
  \item{ID}{Integer: Unique ID emulating individual patients}
  \item{time}{Integer: Time of observation, always begins at 0, max time of 59; however, if lost-to-followup, time is truncated at a random point}
  \item{eligible}{Binary: eligibility criteria for timepoints}
  \item{outcome}{Binary: If an outcome is observed at this time point}
  \item{tx_init}{Integer: Which treatment is observed at this time point}
  \item{sex}{Binary: Sex of the emulated patient}
  \item{N}{Numeric: Normal random variable from N\(10,5\)}
  \item{L}{Numeric: 4\% continuously increase from U\(0, 1\)}
  \item{P}{Numeric: 2\% continuously decrease from U\(9, 10\)}
  \item{excusedOne}{Binary: Once one, always one variable emulating an excuse for treatment switch}
  \item{excusedZero}{Binary: Once zero, always zero variable emulating an excuse for treatment switch}
